My 1st GUI Project with Python

Making a GUI programm using "tkinter" module. 
Main purpose for programm is to convert image file types(.jpg,.png,.tiff) to (.jpg,png). (svg will be added later)
The other function is multi-image viewing at one time and some basic options coming with it (Delete,Move,Rename - etc.)
Programm will have some useless gadgets/functions like stats display, change palette colors - Mostly doing it for my self-learning.

The idea for programm came when I was playing with DeepFake/Faceswap etc. and my programm for editing videos had only one way to compress video into images -> .tiff -What I needed was PNG sequence. I checked on the Internet but could not find satisfying for me programm. I converted images by writing and running a script and thought how nice it would be to have an easy and a little overkill programm for the purpose.
